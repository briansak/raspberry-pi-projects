Miscellaneous projects for Raspberry Pi:

Skull - Anamatronic skull that sits on the porch for Halloween and identifies approaching people using a light sensor.  
The skull is triggered to move via servos and plays an audio track to attempt to scare the trick-or-treaters.

Candy - Web-driven candy distribution robot.  Trick-or-treater can spin the virtual spinner and the dispenser is opened
by triggering a motor to pull open the door of the candy chute.
